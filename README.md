# House Price Prediction

## Objective
The House Price Prediction project aimed to analyze and model real-world housing data to accurately predict property prices based on multiple influencing factors. The objective was to perform end-to-end data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using a Random Forest algorithm. This project provided hands-on experience in building, evaluating, and optimizing a machine learning regression model while reinforcing the importance of data-driven decision-making in predictive analytics.

### Skills Learned

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns, trends, and correlations.
- Applied data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
- Built and trained a Random Forest regression model for house price prediction.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
- Gained hands-on experience in end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data ingestion to prediction and evaluation.

### Tools and Packages Used

- **Python** for data analysis, modeling, and implementation.
- **NumPy** for numerical computations and array operations.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization and plotting.
- **Seaborn** for statistical data visualization during EDA.
- **Scikit-learn** for model building, training, prediction, and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and experimentation.

## Steps

### 1. 1. Data Collection and Loading
The housing dataset was loaded using Pandas for analysis and modeling. Initial inspection was performed to understand the structure, size, and attributes of the data.
